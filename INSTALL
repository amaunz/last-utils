Installation Instructions
=========================

You will need the OpenBabel ruby bindings.

1) Install a Ruby implementation, such as Ruby Enterprise (see http://www.rubyenterpriseedition.com/)
2) Compile Openbabel as described in the installation instructions for LAST-PM (see http://last-pm.maunz.de). You may have already done this.
3) In your unpacked Openbabel sources, follow the instruction at http://openbabel.org/, "How to Compile" and "Language bindings for ruby".
